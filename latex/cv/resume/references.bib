  abstract = "Significant strides have been made in supervised learning settings thanks to the successful application of deep learning. Now, recent work has brought the techniques of deep learning to bear on sequential decision processes in the area of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Currently, little is known regarding hyperparameter optimization for DRL algorithms. Given that DRL algorithms are computationally intensive to train, and are known to be sample inefficient, optimizing model hyperparameters for DRL presents significant challenges to established techniques. We provide an open source, distributed Bayesian model-based optimization algorithm, HyperSpace, and show that it consistently outperforms standard hyperparameter optimization techniques across three DRL algorithms."

	abstract = {The emergence and rapid worldwide spread of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has prompted concerted efforts to find successful treatments. The causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), uses its spike (S) protein to gain entry into host cells. Therefore, the S protein presents a viable target to develop a directed therapy. Here, we deployed an integrated artificial intelligence with molecular dynamics simulation approach to provide new details of the S protein structure. Based on a comprehensive structural analysis of S proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and previous human coronaviruses, we found that the protomer state of S proteins is structurally flexible. Without the presence of a stabilizing beta sheet from another protomer chain, two regions in the S2 domain and the hinge connecting the S1 and S2 subunits lose their secondary structures. Interestingly, the region in the S2 domain was previously identified as an immunodominant site in the SARS-CoV-1 S protein. We anticipate that the molecular details elucidated here will assist in effective therapeutic development for COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
