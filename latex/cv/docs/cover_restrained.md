Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Machine Learning Data Engineer position in the Advanced
Computing in Health Sciences section. I worked in this group from 2017 to 2021,
developing deep learning pipelines for the NCI cancer pathology reports that remain
central to your research. I would welcome the opportunity to return.

During those years, I built production infrastructure for the CANDLE project spanning
multiple national laboratories and published in JAMIA and IEEE Journal of Biomedical
and Health Informatics. I worked extensively with Summit and DGX systems,
implementing distributed training with PyTorch, Horovod, and DeepSpeed.

After leaving ORNL, I led the transformation of a 60,000-line monolithic codebase
into a microservices architecture at Pinnacle Reliability. I served as the bridge
between research mathematicians and software engineers, designing abstractions that
let researchers focus on domain problems while ensuring production-quality
implementations.

I had originally planned to pursue a PhD while at ORNL—a path I was exploring with
researchers in my group before circumstances changed. This position would allow me to
return to that work.

I have institutional knowledge of the NCI pathology dataset, familiarity with ORNL's
computing resources, and experience collaborating across research teams. I believe I
could contribute meaningfully to your work.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Ada Young
