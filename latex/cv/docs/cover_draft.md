Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Machine Learning Data Engineer position
within the Advanced Computing in Health Sciences section at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory. Having spent four years at ORNL developing machine learning methods for
healthcare research—including work with the NCI cancer pathology reports that remain
central to your team's research—I am excited about the opportunity to return and
contribute to the intersection of high-performance computing and biomedical research.

During my time at ORNL (2017-2021), I developed deep learning pipelines for
HIPAA-compliant clinical data, built production infrastructure for the CANDLE project
spanning multiple national laboratories, and published research in venues including
JAMIA and IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics. I worked on the Titan
and Summit supercomputers, as well as DGX systems, implementing distributed training
workflows using PyTorch, Horovod, DeepSpeed, and PyTorch Distributed. This work gave
me both the technical foundation and the research experience that I am eager to
expand upon.

My subsequent role at Pinnacle Reliability provided valuable perspective on
production machine learning systems and research-to-production workflows. I led the
transformation of a 60,000-line monolithic codebase into a scalable microservices
architecture, and served as the technical bridge between a team of research
mathematicians and software engineers. This experience taught me how to design
abstractions that enable researchers to focus on domain problems while ensuring
production-quality implementations—skills that directly translate to supporting
biomedical researchers in building robust ML applications.

The opportunity to return to a research environment where advancing scientific
knowledge is the primary mission is compelling. My industry experience strengthened
my software engineering and infrastructure capabilities — skills that I believe will
strengthen your research teams' aims. I had originally planned to pursue a PhD while
at ORNL, a path I was exploring with researchers while working at the lab before
extenuating circumstances at the time proved to make this difficult. This position
would allow me to re-engage with that goal while contributing to impactful healthcare
informatics projects.

What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to bring together my research
background, healthcare ML expertise, and production infrastructure experience to
support the ACH section's mission. I have institutional knowledge of the NCI
pathology dataset, deep familiarity with ORNL's computing resources, and demonstrated
ability to collaborate across research teams—as evidenced by my contributions to
projects with NVIDIA engineers and the Horovod development team. I am confident I can
immediately contribute to your team while pursuing meaningful research outcomes.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my unique combination of ORNL research
experience and production ML infrastructure expertise can support your team's goals.
Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Ada Young
