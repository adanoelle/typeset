Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Machine Learning Data Engineer position in the Advanced
Computing in Health Sciences section. I worked in this group from 2017 to 2021,
developing deep learning pipelines for the NCI cancer pathology reports that remain
central to your research. The opportunity to return to this work is one I have
thought about often.

During those years, I built production infrastructure for the CANDLE project spanning
multiple national laboratories and published in JAMIA and IEEE Journal of Biomedical
and Health Informatics. I worked extensively with Summit and DGX systems,
implementing distributed training with PyTorch, Horovod, and DeepSpeed. This
foundation shaped how I think about both research and engineering.

My subsequent role at Pinnacle Reliability offered a different kind of education. I
led the transformation of a 60,000-line monolithic codebase into a microservices
architecture and served as the bridge between research mathematicians and software
engineers. I learned to design abstractions that let researchers focus on domain
problems while ensuring production-quality implementations—skills I would be glad to
bring back to a research environment.

I had originally planned to pursue a PhD while at ORNL, a path I was exploring with
researchers in my group before circumstances changed. This position would allow me to
re-engage with that goal while contributing to work I find genuinely meaningful.

What draws me to this role is the chance to bring together my research background,
healthcare ML expertise, and production infrastructure experience in service of the
ACH section's mission. I have institutional knowledge of the NCI pathology dataset,
familiarity with ORNL's computing resources, and experience collaborating across
research teams. I believe I could contribute meaningfully from day one.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience might support your
team's goals. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Ada Young
